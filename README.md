These are the [cmocean](http://matplotlib.org/cmocean/) colormaps saved as CSV files, in a format that makes it possible to import them into Petrel. They can be imported into the 'seismic color tables' folder that can be found in the 'Templates' tab, by right clicking onto the folder and selecting 'Import'.
